Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. The script also uses Requests module for fetching the webpage and posting an alert to IFTTT Webhook.  

The key features are:

* **Scrapes Continuously**: The script tries to fetch the updated market level every 5 mins.
* **Choice of Level to Track**: The user is given a choice to set the market level to track and laert  
* **Mobile Notifications**: The user gets a Notification on Mobile device
* **System Alert Sound**: The script plays an Alert sound on the system it's running.
